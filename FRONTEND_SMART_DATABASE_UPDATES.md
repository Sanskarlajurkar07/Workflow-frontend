- **knowledgeBaseService.ts**: Enhanced with search and task monitoring APIs

### New State Management
```typescript
// Search functionality
const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState('');
const [searchResults, setSearchResults] = useState<SearchResponse | null>(null);
const [searchLoading, setSearchLoading] = useState(false);

// Task monitoring
const [activeTasks, setActiveTasks] = useState<any>({});
const [taskPolling, setTaskPolling] = useState(false);

// Document addition
const [showAddDocModal, setShowAddDocModal] = useState(false);
const [newDocUrl, setNewDocUrl] = useState('');
const [newDocName, setNewDocName] = useState('');
const [newDocType, setNewDocType] = useState<'url' | 'integration' | 'recursive_url'>('url');
```

### New API Methods
```typescript
// Search functionality
searchSmartDatabase: (dbId: string, query: string, topK: number = 5) => Promise<SearchResponse>

// Task monitoring
getActiveTasks: (dbId: string) => Promise<any>
```

### Enhanced Type Definitions
```typescript
export interface SearchResponse {
  query: string;
  results: SearchResult[];
  total_results: number;
  search_time: string;
}

export interface SearchResult {
  text: string;
  score: number;
  source: string;
  document_id: string;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
}
```
